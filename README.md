    <h1 align="center">Occupancy Management System</h1>
    <br>
</p>

With the tourism boom in many areas of the country, micro and private businesses offering
boarding and accommodations services are becoming prevalent. Not only do these businesses
support the local tourism, but also boosts the businesses of the area. However, despite the
increase in demand for these types of businesses and technological development, owners and
overseers are, more often than not, utilizing traditional means of management and monitoring.

In order to provide an automated system that these businesses can use, I am proposing the
development of an Occupancy Management System (OMS). OMS is a web-based system
geared towards the storage and monitoring of occupancy information and processes for small
businesses focused on providing boarding and accommodation services. 

This system aims to help small businesses such as boarding houses, dormitories, transient lodgings, 
and such. OMS will feature tools for occupant information storage, lease monitoring, and occupancy
reports. Through these tools, OMS aims to automate and streamline the processes that owners
and overseers of these types of businesses undertake in order to manage their business.
